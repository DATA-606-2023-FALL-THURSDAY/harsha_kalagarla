**Predicting Baltimore Employees Salary:**
-  The predictive analysis study for the "Balmore_City_Employee_Salaries.csv" dataset is explained in this executive summary.
-  The dataset contains information about Baltimore City employees, including names, job titles, agency
-  IDs, agency names, hire dates, annual salaries, gross salaries, and fiscal years.
