<H2>2. Background</H2><br>
* What is it about?<br>
* Car price prediction,driven by data analysis and machine learning,is essential in today's automotive industry. It help
buyers and sellers make informed decisions by estimating a vehicle's value based on factors like make, model, mileage, and
market demand. This process benefits consumers, sellers, and industry stakeholders alike.

* Why does it matter?<br>
* It empowers buyers to make cost-effective choices and sellers to set competitive prices, ensuring fair transactions.
Provides valuable data for manufacturers, dealerships, and analysts to understand market trends and consumer preferences.Insurance companies and lenders use price predictions to evaluate vehicle values for risk assessment and financial decisions. Helps optimize production, marketing, inventory management, and insurance premiums in the automotive industry. Influences economic decisions and policies related to the automotive sector.<br>

* What are your research questions?<br>
•	Is there a correlation between the age of a car and its selling price, and how does this vary by car brand and fuel type?<br>
•	Can a predictive model be developed to estimate the depreciation of cars over time, taking into account various factors?<br>
•	How does the number of previous owners affect the resale value of a car?<br>
•	Are there any specific factors that influence the resale value of cars with multiple owners?<br>
•	Can time series analysis reveal seasonal patterns or trends in car selling prices over the years?<br>
•	Can a recommendation system be developed to suggest cars to potential buyers based on their preferences and budget constraints?<br>
